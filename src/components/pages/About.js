      <h2>About the file structure</h2>
      <p className="lead-text"><strong>Notice:</strong> this is <em>not</em> the recommended approach for single app projects.</p>
      <p>
        This application structure breaks from recommended React practices and is highly tailored to personal choices and practices in terms of systems architecture.<br/>
        As such, please don't consider it so much as a point of reference but merely as a starter kit yet to be adapted to your workflow and projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming from a <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" title="visit Gulp.js website">Gulp</a> workflow, I've always used an external Sass structure for the styling of my projects, mostly relying on the <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern" title="the 7-1 pattern on Sass guidelines">7-1 Pattern</a> and Jonathan Snook's <a href="https://smacss.com/" title="about SMACSS by Jonathan Snook">SMACSS</a> approach for engineering a versatile yet optimized pattern-library for complex applications.<br/>
        With the growing trends of system architectures being based on micro-services, pattern-libraries have taken some serious new turns since SMACSS, but even though most of us have nowadays adopted <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" title="Atomic Design Methodolgy by Brad Frost">Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodoly</a>, its actual implementation across a varied range of technologies often still rely on such external stylesheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Webpack has some very interesting tools to facilitate the transition towards fully independent components in frameworks like Vue or React (Styled Components, Scoped CSS modules).<br/>
        This project is <strong>not</strong> an attempt at exploring them, but the voluntary intention to develop a React boilerplate compatible with an external and technology-agnostic pattern-library approach.<br/>
        Check my recommended readings below should you aim for a more standard single app approach.

      <h2>Recommended readings</h2>
      <p>
        Even though this project does not use the latest technics or recommended approaches, it is the result of many readings about React, Webpack, modern front-end development stacks and best practices.<br/>
        Whether you're a beginner or a savvy front-end engineer, you should find some of those very interesting.
